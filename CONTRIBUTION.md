# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution. These guidelines keep changes consistent and reviewable.

## Getting started

- Fork or create a topic branch from `main` for each change.
- Keep pull requests focused; avoid mixing unrelated changes.

## Development expectations

- Update documentation alongside code changes (README, PROJECT_FILES, CHANGELOG when behavior or assets change).
- Add or adjust tests to cover new or changed behavior; for now, include Play Mode notes in `TESTING.md`.
- Run tests and linters locally before opening a pull request; for Unity changes, include a brief Play Mode verification note in the PR.

## Commit and PR hygiene

- Write clear commit messages that explain the why, not just the what.
- In pull requests, include a short summary, testing performed, and any known gaps.
- Link related issues when available.

## Code review

- Be responsive to feedback and keep discussion respectful.
- Prefer small, incremental updates when addressing review comments.
